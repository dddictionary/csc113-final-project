# csc113-final-project


## Todo (list stuff here to finish):
- ~~implement player class and the movment functions~~
- ~~implemenet the board with it's cells~~
- ~~implemenet all game rules~~
- ~~create a game class that takes the board and player classes as arguments and runs the actual game itself.~~
- ~~implement the main.py file such that we can run the game from there.~~
- implement animations for the game such as when tiles are moved.
- add sounds? (maybe)
- add documentation to all the functions and classes.
## Make sure to comment above each function on what it does and why we need it
