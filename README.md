# csc113-final-project


## Todo (list stuff here to finish):
- ~~implement player class and the movment functions~~
- ~~implemenet the board with it's cells~~
- ~~implemenet all game rules~~
- create a game class that takes the board and player classes as arguments and runs the actual game itself.
- implement the main.py file such that we can run the game from there.

## Make sure to comment above each function on what it does and why we need it
